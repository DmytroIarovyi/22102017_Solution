# 22102017_Solution

 - Was implemented in Visual Studio 2017. Selenium WebDriver and c# was used (installed via NuGet).
 - To use it, open solution (.sln) file in Visual Studio. Navigate to Tests folder and choose appropriate file with tests. Push "Run tests"
 - Majority of tests will fail due to no access to Database and deleting the account, which is required in tests. If access to Database is received all of those tests will be green (after small changes in code)
 - Not all functionality was covered with tests due to lack of time
